For wine, I suggest the Merlot by Marchesi Antinori, Italy. The steak is priced at 2500 RUB and the wine is 2800 RUB per glass."

Would you like me to suggest a different wine that would complement your dish better? Perhaps a white wine such as Sauvignon Blanc or Chardonnay might be a good choice."
